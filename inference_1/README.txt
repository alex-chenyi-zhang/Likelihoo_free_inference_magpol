Here I do the most basic version to try out the inference task. In this version the external field is just given one sequence feature (CpG fraction) multiplied by a weight which is the only unknown parameter on which we carry out the inference task. In the "synthetic_data/" folder I run a simulation with the ground truth value of the weight and I take one sample of the spins configuration as my data. Then in this folder I run a long simulation with a random starting value of the weight and do a long simulation until equilibration is roughly reached. A little modification to the initialization function of the saw_MC class has to be made. Instead of reading the external fields directly from a file, read the feature vector instead and then initialize the fields by multiplying the features by the weight.
